                <p>
                    Create a group that meets regularly to see presentations on tools, methods, threats, and whatever the group deems noteworthy.  We can invite guest speakers from groups and companies that are doing things right, doing things differently, or making waves in this space. The goal is to create a community that shares information and has each other's backs.  Nebraskans helping Nebraskans.

                    After every gathering, folks should leave enlightened, and knowing something they didn't when they walked in off the street.

                <p>
                    Cities across the country have active, engaged Information Security groups.  It's time for Lincoln to join the ranks.  From startups to global companies, everybody has a need for quality InfoSec people.  Lincoln has poeple who work these problems every day, people who do it as "other duties as assigned", and diamonds in the rough.  Just because someone doesn't work 9-5 in IT or security doesn't make them any less valuable to the community.  The "next great thing" might be working at your local grocery store and burning up the net in their off time.  This community is meant to be as inclusive as possible.

                <p>
                    Information Security (InfoSec) is an umbrella term for a vast world of topics.  From offensive to defensive, "hacking" to building defensable, resilient systems, this whole subject area effects our everyday lives.  The digital battleground never sleeps and people step into it every day whether they know or not.  Whether you work in the field every day, or just have a passing interest, if InfoSec floats your boat, this could be the place for you.
